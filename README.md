      What we aimed to accomplish
    </h2>
    <p>
       The project was originally supposed to make a neural network that learns to solve <a href = "https://github.com/shivamshekhar/Chrome-T-Rex-Rush">this dino game</a>.  unfortunately because of technical difficulties with the programs and libraries such as keras which handle neural networks we were unable to.
    </p>
    <p> 
       We resorted to a hard bot which does not learn but follows certain rules in which we laid out. We also wanted to make the program to all be handled through a website so that others can easily view the project. After countless fails with programs like skulpt and brython we found <a href="https://repl.it">repl</a>. The website allowed us to run the library PYGAME, which is the entire basis for the dino game and the bot, to run in a browser without us hosting hosting it in another window.
