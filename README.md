      How to play:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once on the <a href = "https://coolkid67.github.io/CTY-Term-Project/">main webpage, </a> you can go to the actual game by pressing "Launch." Then, you'll be in a split-screen view which shows the source code, actual game, and output log. Pressing run will allow you to choose either to play or watch the bot play. If you choose to play, you can press space to jump and the down arrow key to duck or fall faster.

    <h2>
      Original goal:
    </h2>
    <p>
       The project was originally supposed to make a neural network that learns to solve <a href = "https://github.com/shivamshekhar/Chrome-T-Rex-Rush">this Dino Game implementation</a>. Due to lack of experience with neural networks, and the topic's complexity, we were unable to finish this in the amount of time we had. We also wanted to make the program to all be handled through a website so that others can easily view the project. We tried using <a href = "https://skulpt.org/">Skulpt</a> (a Python interpreter written in JavaScript) and <a href = "https://brython.info">Brython, </a> (a Python to JavaScript compiler) but were inexperienced with JavaScript and had trouble configuring the programs to handle Pygame properly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How we changed our goal:
    </h2>
    <p> 
       Since the Chrome Dino Game is a relatively simple game, we were able to use a hardcoded bot which had a list of instructions to follow rather than gradually learning through trial and error. Instead of hosting the game on our own website, we were able to embed our project from <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>, which worked out with us making it open-source. The website allowed us to run the library Pygame much more easily than with either Skulpt and Brython.
